  <h1 class="post-title">Vagrant, we meet again</h1>
  <span class="post-date">13 Mar 2016</span>
  <p>I haven’t logged into my desktop vagrant box since October 2015. After logging in a couple of days ago, I managed to mess things up, and lost my VM (might have to do with the VirtualBox upgrade). It wasn’t a big deal though, it was the box spun up from the <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/getting-started/">Getting Started</a> tutorial. Although, I did attempt to fix the problem by following <a href="http://zachwills.net/fix-for-vagrant-not-detecting-existing-vm/">this blog post</a> but ultimately failed as when I did a <code>vagrant up</code> it would not connect because of authentication and so I disposed of the box. In the process of trying to acquire a new Linux environment, I found out that 64-bit boxes would not work for whatever reason (this needed some looking into that I clearly didn’t want to do, vagrant bugs are notorious and I didn’t want to spend hours trying to fix this, speaking from experience), The boxes that I attempted to install are <strong>hashicorp/precise64</strong> and <strong>ubuntu/trusty64</strong>, both of which failed. And so, I had to stick with my old <strong>hashicorp/precise32</strong> box.</p>

<p>The reason that I needed a Linux environment in my Windows machine was to run some C++ programs. I am currently a TA for an introductory course that requires me to grade programs. I didn’t want to do things on my small laptop screen and thought things would be much smoother on my larger 23-inch desktop monitor. Yeah, I know that it is completely overkill as all I needed to do was install <a href="http://www.mingw.org/">MinGW</a> and the compiler. But after getting used to working on Linux on my laptop, MinGW is just not good enough. Who knows, maybe I might need to run some Python later on, or anything that is a nightmare setting up on Windows (everything).</p>

<p>After loading the box, I did a quick <code>vagrant ssh</code> and ran the usual:</p>

<p><code>shell
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
</code></p>

<p>to get the machine up to date, and proceeded to install the software I needed, <code>gcc, vim, git and some python tools</code>.</p>

<p>Process was relatively fast, about 10 minutes and I now had a fully working Linux environment. Maybe that is a bit of a stretch as I can only access the box through <code>ssh</code> but good enough. With some basic tooling up, I needed to re-create my development environment which mainly includes of adding my <code>.vimrc and .bash_aliases</code>. I have had to do this process a couple of times from the servers that I have had to configure so it might be time to learn some shell scripting and automate this process.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>If you need a quick and dirty way to set up a Linux environment on Windows, the <strong>Cygwin + Vagrant</strong> combo is pretty good. The only downside is that you to learn some UNIX basics, and it’s preferred if you know Vim, although they do provide you with a shared folder where you can edit files with your native editor.</p>
