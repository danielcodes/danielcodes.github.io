  <h1 class="post-title">Thinkpad saves the day</h1>
  <span class="post-date">02 Jan 2016</span>
  <p>The first laptop I bought, a <a href="http://www.cnet.com/products/lenovo-y40-70-laptop-59423030-black-doorbuster-4th-generation-intel-core-i7-4510u-2-00ghz-1600-mhz-4mb/specs/">Lenovo Y40</a>, turned out to be horrible disappointment. From a keyboard that I didn&#39;t like, a screen resolution that sucked and to top things off the battery died on me after 5 months of usage. It didn&#39;t completely die on me, but the darn machine would not work unless it was plugged in. Rendering my laptop&#39;s portability useless, as everytime I&#39;d need ot use it, boot up was necessary. I sent in the laptop since it was still under warranty but I was still in need of a laptop for my coding needs as school was already in session.</p>

<p>I first resorted to borrowing a friend&#39;s tiny notebook. It was a really tiny machine with Ubuntu on it, ultimately the laptop&#39;s keyboard was too small and the fan noise was irritable enough to keep me from using it. But I&#39;d found something cool, that Linux could run on machines with minimal specs! </p>

<p><img src="/public/img/laptop/screen.jpg" alt="Screen"></p>

<p>I started looking around for cheap computer options, and eventually after much fishing, chose to buy a used ThinkPad T420. You can find these <a href="http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&amp;_trksid=p2050601.m570.l1311.R1.TR12.TRC2.A0.H0.Xthinkpad+t.TRS0&amp;_nkw=thinkpad+t420&amp;_sacat=0">under 200 on ebay</a>. I coughed up a tiny bit more to get one that wasn&#39;t too beat up. The specs were decent, i5, 250GB storage and 4GB RAM, more than enough for any Linux OS. After receiving the computer, I instantly liked it a lot more than the being-repaired Y40. The screen was still mediocre but the keyboard made a world&#39;s difference. One thing that I can&#39;t stand is having a shortened right SHIFT key. Exactly what the Y40 had, and to add onto the bad design, the keys had the depth of about a nanometer. This ThinkPad had the old school IBM keyboards, it felt clicky, and the right SHIFT was not shortened. The only downside is that, it is literally a brick to carry around.</p>

<p><img src="/public/img/laptop/keyboard.jpg" alt="Keyboard"></p>

<p>Soon after, a friend helped me install Linux on it, specifically <a href="https://ubuntugnome.org/">Ubuntu-GNOME</a>. It felt good to finally work in this OS after many failed attempts to get it on VirtualBox. Not that I failed, the VM&#39;s ran so slow (2 - 3 second delays), that it was pretty unbearable so I gave up on it. Then I found about Vagrant + Cygwin, which initially cost me a lot of grief (it lost my VM at some point). But I did have Linux-y tools for a brief period of time (troubled times with symlinks and shared folders).</p>

<p>I really can&#39;t emphasize how good it is once you make the switch to a Linux OS. I&#39;m being biased here, as I&#39;ve always wanted this environment where I can just do all my work in a terminal. But if you&#39;re a developer or an aspiring programmer, definitely try it out this set up if you have 200 bucks to spare.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> Don&#39;t be fooled by a laptop&#39;s specs. If you just want to program, buy a cheap Thinkpad and throw Linux on it. Or get a Mac if you can afford it.</p>
