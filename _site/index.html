		I have had my eye on Free Code Camp for a while now, but I saw that it was teaching lot of the basics that I felt that I had already learned (at least some of it). But, after getting told on a phone interview that I would need to do a coding challenge in Javascript, I immediately jumped onto the Algorithms section and did as many of the challenges as time allowed. I...

		I signed up to give a web development workshop for my school’s ACM club. Beginning with the basics HTML/CSS to creating a small application with Flask. Planning this has been a little tougher than expected as to what I want people to come out the workshop knowing. Of course, the musts are the main three elements that go into a web framework:  URL handling Templating Object Relational Mapper (ORM)  With Flask, one and...

		I had derp moment this Thursday when I thought a deed was done when it wasn’t.  Things are not done until they’re done.  I should have known as the procedure felt super rushed and I was just so hyped that there had been a tiny bit of progress on what had been a week long struggle. This reminded me of 2014’s Rockets vs. Trail Blazers playoff series. The Rockets were up 2, but...

		I had a very productive winter break. I managed to hit alot of milestones and that required a drastic change in my day to day routine. Amongst the things that I accomplished are:  Finishing 3 Pluralsight courses  Advanced Javascript Python Fundamentals Python Beyond the Basics   Doing a chapter a day from the Test Driven Development with Python book  I started by reading the You-Dont-Know-JS book series, managed to get...

		After deciding on the theme that I wanted to use for this site, Hyde. I was also actively looking for ways to improve my site. I found this really helpful article, which helped me add an Archive to see my posts in log format, Analytics to track views and Comments for feedback.
