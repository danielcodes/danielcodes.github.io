I have had my eye on [Free Code Camp](http://www.freecodecamp.com/) for a while now, but I saw that it was teaching lot of the basics that I felt that I'd already learned (at least some of it). But, after getting told on a phone interview that I would need to do a coding challenge in Javascript, I immediately jumped onto the Algorithms section and did as many as time allowed. I was dumb and did not pick a large enough window to practice these exercises. Of course, this was all after I was panicking as to what would be the best way to practice. I found the exercises, quite enjoyable and I managed to cram all the exercises in 2 days. Not bad for something that's supposed to take an estimated 50 hours. Guess these 4 years in college haven't been for nothing, HAHA.

However, this wasn't met without some resistance. I wasn't super smooth at completing all the challenges and a couple of them took a fair bit of head banging. Here are some of the things I learned,


### DO NOT be a blind coder

`console.log(all_things)`

By this, I mean that do not write a mess of logic without making sure that these logic steps are correct. ie. if you're creating an array of values, **PRINT** that array and make sure that those values are there, same thing goes if you're modifying it, always check that the output is as expected. The saying goes, 

> Seeing is believing

which is absolutely true for programming, do not program blindly. 


### Incorporate functional programming 

This turned out to be a good chance to practice functional programming. Getting used to applying, `map(), filter() and reduce()` whenever possible. If you don't know what those are, here's a brief overview:

* Map, applies a function to each element of an array
* Filter, same as map, but only keeps the elements that return true
* Reduce, takes an array and compresses it into a single value

Some examples for each of these functions are, adding one to each element, getting the odds/evens and getting the sum of integers. Check out the [Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array) here.


### Use all the built-ins

Most of the time, a lot of the functionality that you require is already provided in a method. A good example are strings, there is `split(), join(), splice(), etc' just to name a few. Check out [Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String) here.

## Conclusion

That sums it up. See your output, do not code logic on top of logic without seeing the results. Try to use `map, filter and reduce`, chances are there are plenty of use cases. And use built-ins, these methods are there to make your life easier. With that said, happy coding :D
